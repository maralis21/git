<Intro>

TypeScript is a popular way to add type definitions to JavaScript codebases. Out of the box, TypeScript [supports JSX](/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) and you can get full React support by adding [`@types/react-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-dom) to your project.

All of the production-grade frameworks mentioned in [Start a New React Project](/learn/start-a-new-react-project) offer support for using TypeScript with React, we recommend consulting their documentation for more information on setup. This guide assumes you have your project configured to support writing TypeScript React files as `*.tsx`.

## TypeScript with React {/*typescript-with-react*/}

<Sandpack>

```tsx App.tsx active
const a = "";

function Greeting({ name } : { name: string }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
  return <Greeting name="world" />
}
```

</Sandpack>

 <Note>

These sandboxes can handle TypeScript code, but they do not run the type-checker. This means you can amend the TypeScript sandboxes to learn, but you won't get any type errors or warnings. To get type-checking, you can use the [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) or use an online sandbox.

### Try React locally {/*try-react-locally*/}

To try React locally on your computer, [download this HTML page.](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/0275b1e1518599bbeafcde4722e79ed1/raw/db72dcbf3384ee1708c4a07d3be79860db04bff0/example.html) Open it in your editor and in your browser!

## Start a new React project {/*start-a-new-react-project*/}

If you want to build an app or a website fully with React, [start a new React project.](/learn/start-a-new-react-project)

## Add React to an existing project {/*add-react-to-an-existing-project*/}

If want to try using React in your existing app or a website, [add React to an existing project.](/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project)

## Next steps {/*next-steps*/}
