## How to contribute {/*how-to-contribute*/}

You can contribute to the translation efforts! The community conducts the translation work for the React docs on each language-specific fork of react.dev. Typical translation work involves directly translating a Markdown file and creating a pull request. Visit the GitHub repository for your language, and follow the instructions there or contact one of the maintainers.
