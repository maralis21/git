## Guidelines for Documentation

### Syntax

- Please use ES2015 syntax unless explicitly explaining that stage-X features require transformation.
  - This means use `bind` in constructor over class properties (`x = () => { ... }`)
- Prefer JSX to `React.createElement` 
- Use semicolons
- No space between function names and parens (`method() {}` not `method () {}`)
