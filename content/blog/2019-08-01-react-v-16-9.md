## [`React.Profiler`](/docs/profiler.html) {#profiler}

The `Profiler` measures how often a React application renders and what the "cost" of rendering is. Its purpose is to help identify parts of an application that are slow and may benefit from [optimizations such as memoization](/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-memoize-calculations).

A `Profiler` can be added anywhere in a React tree to measure the cost of rendering that part of the tree.
It requires two props: an `id` (string) and an [`onRender` callback](/docs/profiler.html#onrender-callback) (function) which React calls any time a component within the tree "commits" an update.

```js{2,7}
render(
  <Profiler id="application" onRender={onRenderCallback}>
    <App>
      <Navigation {...props} />
      <Main {...props} />
    </App>
  </Profiler>
);
```

To learn more about the `Profiler` and the parameters passed to the `onRender` callback, check out [the `Profiler` docs](/docs/profiler.html).

> Note:
>
> Profiling adds some additional overhead, so **it is disabled in [the production build](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build)**.
>
> To opt into production profiling, React provides a special production build with profiling enabled.
> Read more about how to use this build at [fb.me/react-profiling](https://fb.me/react-profiling)
