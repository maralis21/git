## [`React.Profiler`](/docs/profiler.html) {#profiler}

The `Profiler` measures how often a React application renders and what the "cost" of rendering is. Its purpose is to help identify parts of an application that are slow and may benefit from optimizations such as memoization.

The profiler accepts a callback function ([`onRender`](/docs/profiler.html#onrender-callback)) which React calls any time a descendant component "commits" an update.

```js{2,7}
render(
  <Profiler id="application" onRender={onRenderCallback}>
    <App>
      <Navigation {...props} />
      <Main {...props} />
    </App>
  </Profiler>
);
```

To learn more about the `Profiler` and the parameters passed to the `onRender` callback, check out [the `Profiler` docs](/docs/profiler.html).

> Note: This profiler does not record times in production mode.
>
> Profiling adds some additional overhead, so it is disabled in the production build.
> React provides a special production build with profiling enabled.
